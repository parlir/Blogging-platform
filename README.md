# Blogging-platform
What I want from a blogging platform

1. Full access without requiring a profile.
2. RSS feeds for individual blogs.
3. Put the blog at the center (minimize banners etc...)
4. Good editor for creating content.
   - I wonder if using a base like org-mode would work here? (I do like the way they create tables)
   - I think TinyMCE is a good choice here it's flexible and offers plugins / extensibility
5. A good way to comment, more generally create responses to content.

The biggest thing in all of this though is full access to all content without any sort of advertising of the platform itself.

## Advantages over hosting a blog
There's two audiences a blogging platform caters too consumers of content and producers. 
On the producer side the advantage has to be related to ease of producing content and getting it out to an audience.
For the consumer it's being able to quickly find an aggregation of high quality content that caters to their preference.

### Consumer
- Have access to an aggregation of quality content.
- Tailor content to fit their requirements (IE tech blog, cooking / whatever).
### Producer
- Easy of writing and publishing content.
- Visiblity to their target audience

## Where Medium fails
- I have yet to see a way to have a stream of content related to blogs that I'm following ... This is a big deal I don't want content showing up that I'm disinterested in that's algorithmically generated (poorly) I want content that I've explicitly said "Yes show me this publication".
- It doesn't put the blog at the forefront (it puts it's own platform).
- What this means is large banners related to Medium and not having access to content. The reality is I'm there to look at a post not be bombarded with things unrelated.
- It doesn't put producing content at the forefront. It's hidden behind a menu item.
- It mixes comments with stories (This occurs in multiple areas on rss feeds, in writing stories and comments).
